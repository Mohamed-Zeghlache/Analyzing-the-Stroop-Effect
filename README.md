# Analyzing the Stroop Effect

in this project i'll analyze the stroop effect using a paired t-test which is a dependent test, because the same group of units has been tested twice.

## Steps and tools used :
i have made some descreptive statistical analysis on the data

i have also made some visualisations to have a better understanding of the data 

i have made a hypothesis testing (paired t-test) 

## Conclusion
finaly, i have noticed that there is a difference between the population means of congruent and incongruent times.
